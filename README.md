# hello-world-async
● Create a simple python program with 2 methods. One method prints “Hello” and the other
method prints “World”. Call these methods concurrently & asynchronously. That is, both
methods are invoked at the same instant, not one after the other. So on console you
should sometimes see “World Hello” and sometimes “Hello World” depending on which
method is invoked first. Repeat these calls every 10 seconds and stop after 1 minute.

● Expected Result: On the console you should see 6 combinations, a mix of “Hello World”
and “World Hello”
